This is a web platform developed as part of a university course on IT projects. The system is designed to facilitate interaction between university partners and students for the purpose of implementing commercial projects. At the moment, this project is complete, even though it is not perfect and has some bugs in the UI.

The project includes:

- Team creation and management (add/remove members, join a team, edit team data);

- User profiles, including personal technology stacks;

- Registration and login with JWT protection;

- Role system: student, partner, or teacher;

- Project creation;

- Moderation of applications for creating projects or teams;

- Interaction between projects and teams (teams submit applications to participate, and the project author selects one team from those proposed);

- Real-time notifications via WebSocket;

- Private and group chats via WebSocket.
